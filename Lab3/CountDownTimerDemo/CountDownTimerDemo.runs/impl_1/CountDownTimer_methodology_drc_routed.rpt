2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin display_driver/binCounter/ff1/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin display_driver/binCounter/ff1/nQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin display_driver/binCounter/ff2/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin display_driver/binCounter/ff2/nQ_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.423 ns between pulse_generator/s_counter_reg[8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pulse_generator/pulse2Hz_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
