2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.428 ns between pulse_generator/s_counter_reg[8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pulse_generator/blink2Hz_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.630 ns between pulse_generator/s_counter_reg[9]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pulse_generator/blink1Hz_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.797 ns between pulse_generator/s_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and pulse_generator/pulse2Hz_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
